# invo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All code MUST meet established quality standards before merge. Code MUST be readable,
maintainable, and follow established patterns. Linting and formatting tools MUST be
configured and enforced. Code reviews MUST verify adherence to quality standards.
Technical debt MUST be documented and prioritized for resolution.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Tests MUST be written before implementation code. All tests MUST pass before merge.
Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds: 80% line coverage, 90% critical path coverage.
Tests MUST be fast, reliable, and independent. Integration tests MUST cover all
user-facing workflows and API contracts.

### III. User Experience Consistency

All user interfaces MUST follow consistent design patterns and interaction models.
User feedback MUST be immediate and informative. Error states MUST provide clear
guidance for resolution. Accessibility requirements MUST be met for all interfaces.
User flows MUST be validated through usability testing.

### IV. Performance Requirements

All features MUST meet defined performance benchmarks before release. API responses
MUST complete within 200ms for 95th percentile. UI interactions MUST provide feedback
within 100ms. Resource usage MUST be monitored and optimized. Performance regressions
MUST be caught and resolved before deployment.

### V. Observable and Maintainable Systems

All components MUST provide comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing. System state
MUST be observable through monitoring dashboards. Errors MUST be tracked and alerted.
Documentation MUST be maintained alongside code changes. Deployment and rollback
procedures MUST be automated and tested.

## Quality Standards

All code changes MUST pass automated quality gates including:

- Static analysis and security scanning
- Automated testing with required coverage thresholds
- Performance benchmark validation
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Documentation completeness checks

## Development Workflow

Code review is MANDATORY for all changes. Reviewers MUST verify constitutional
compliance before approval. Continuous integration MUST enforce all quality gates.
Feature flags MUST be used for gradual rollouts. All deployments MUST be reversible
within 5 minutes. Production incidents MUST trigger post-mortem analysis.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and policies.
Amendments require team consensus and formal documentation. All feature specifications
MUST demonstrate constitutional compliance. Violations MUST be addressed before
proceeding with implementation. Regular compliance audits MUST be conducted quarterly.
