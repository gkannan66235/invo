## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: How should GST functionality be controlled in the system? → A: User preference - Individual operators can toggle GST features
- Q: How long should the system support offline operation during network outages? → A: Full day (24+ hours) with complete standalone operation
- Q: What are the backup storage and data retention requirements? → A: Cloud storage, 1 year retention for compliance
- Q: What barcode scanning capabilities should the system support? → A: Optional feature - manual entry only
- Q: What are the expected growth projections for system scalability? → A: Medium growth - 10,000 to 50,000 transactions/month

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A service center operator needs to manage inventory of pumps, motors, and spare parts, process customer orders, generate GST-compliant invoices, and track stock levels in real-time. The system must handle the complete workflow from inventory management to customer billing while ensuring 100% GST compliance for Indian retail operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an empty inventory, **When** the operator adds new pump stock with GST details, **Then** the system records the item with proper tax classification and current stock levels
2. **Given** available spare parts inventory, **When** a customer requests service with parts replacement, **Then** the system creates a service order, deducts inventory, and generates a GST-compliant invoice
3. **Given** a completed service transaction, **When** the operator finalizes the billing, **Then** the system generates proper GST invoices with all required fields per Indian tax regulations
4. **Given** low stock levels, **When** inventory falls below minimum threshold, **Then** the system alerts the operator and suggests reorder quantities
5. **Given** monthly operations, **When** tax filing period approaches, **Then** the system generates GST return reports in required formats

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GST rates change for existing inventory items?
- How does the system handle partial deliveries and split billing?
- What occurs when network connectivity is lost during transaction processing?
- How are damaged/returned items handled in inventory and GST calculations?
- What happens when customer disputes charges after invoice generation?
