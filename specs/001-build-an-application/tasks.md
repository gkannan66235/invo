# Tasks: GST Compliant Service Center Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-an-application/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, pytest
   → Structure: Containerized web application (backend API + database)
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: 8 entities (InventoryItem, Customer, ServiceOrder, etc.)
   → contracts/: REST API with auth, inventory, customers, orders, invoices
   → research.md: Technology decisions and implementation strategy
   → quickstart.md: 11 test scenarios for validation
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Docker, dependencies, quality tools
   → Tests: Contract tests for all endpoints, integration scenarios
   → Core: SQLAlchemy models, service layers, FastAPI endpoints
   → Integration: Database, middleware, GST calculations
   → Polish: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P] marker)
   → Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Validate: All contracts have tests, all entities have models
```
