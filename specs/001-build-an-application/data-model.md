## Data Integrity Rules

1. **Financial Consistency**: All calculated amounts must match sum of components
2. **Stock Consistency**: Stock movements must maintain accurate running balances
3. **GST Compliance**: Tax calculations must follow Indian GST rules
4. **Audit Trail**: All financial transactions must be traceable
5. **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key relationships must be maintained

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexing Strategy**:

   - Primary keys (UUID) - B-tree indexes
   - Foreign keys - B-tree indexes
   - Search fields (product_code, invoice_number) - Unique indexes
   - Date ranges (invoice_date, service_date) - B-tree indexes

2. **Query Optimization**:

   - Inventory queries by category and active status
   - Customer search by name and phone
   - Invoice queries by date range and status
   - Stock movement queries by item and date range

3. **Data Archival**:
   - Archive completed orders older than 2 years
   - Maintain GST compliance data for 6 years
   - Regular cleanup of cancelled/void transactions

This data model supports all constitutional requirements for testing, performance, and observability while ensuring GST compliance and business rule enforcement.
