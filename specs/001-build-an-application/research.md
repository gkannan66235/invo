# Research & Technology Decisions

## Feature: GST Compliant Service Center Management System

This document consolidates research findings and technology decisions for the GST billing application.

## Core Technology Stack Decisions

### Backend Framework Selection

**Decision**: FastAPI for REST API development  
**Rationale**:

- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation (constitutional requirement for observability)
- Built-in request/response validation with Pydantic
- High performance - async support for concurrent requests
- Type hints enable better code quality (constitutional requirement)
- Rich ecosystem for testing with pytest integration

**Alternatives considered**:

- Django REST Framework: Too heavyweight for API-only service
- Flask: Less built-in functionality, requires more manual setup
- Django: Full MVC framework unnecessary for containerized API

### Database & ORM Selection

**Decision**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM  
**Rationale**:

- ACID compliance essential for financial data (GST calculations, billing)
- Strong JSON support for flexible configuration data
- Excellent container support for deployment strategy
- SQLAlchemy provides database-agnostic code with migration support
- Rich ecosystem for testing and performance monitoring

**Alternatives considered**:

- MySQL: Less robust JSON support
- SQLite: Not suitable for multi-container deployment
- MongoDB: ACID transactions less mature, financial data requires consistency

### Container & Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Docker containers with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)  
**Rationale**:

- Separation of concerns: backend API + database containers
- Scalability for 10K-50K transactions/month growth
- Azure integration for backup and monitoring requirements
- Constitutional observability requirements met with Azure Monitor
- Offline operation capability with local container orchestration

**Alternatives considered**:

- Azure App Service: Less control over container configuration
- Virtual Machines: Higher maintenance overhead
- Azure Container Instances: Limited orchestration capabilities

## GST Compliance Research

### Indian GST Calculation Requirements

**Decision**: Implement configurable GST calculation engine  
**Rationale**:

- GST rates vary by product category (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%)
- HSN code classification required for parts and services
- CGST/SGST split for intra-state, IGST for inter-state transactions
- Feature flag system allows per-user GST preferences

**Key Implementation Points**:

- HSN code database for pumps, motors, spare parts
- Tax calculation service with state-specific logic
- GST invoice format compliance for statutory requirements
- Backup systems for GST data retention (1-year requirement)

### Offline Operation Strategy

**Decision**: Local SQLite cache with PostgreSQL sync  
**Rationale**:

- 24+ hour offline requirement for service center operations
- Local cache maintains critical data during connectivity issues
- Sync mechanism for data consistency when online
- Constitutional performance requirement (<200ms) maintained offline

**Implementation Approach**:

- Background sync service for data replication
- Conflict resolution strategy for concurrent modifications
- Local backup of essential GST and inventory data

## Testing & Quality Strategy

### Test Coverage Implementation

**Decision**: pytest with coverage.py and contract testing  
**Rationale**:

- Constitutional requirement: 80% line coverage, 90% critical path
- Contract tests ensure API consistency for integrations
- Integration tests for GST calculation workflows
- Unit tests for business logic validation

**Testing Categories**:

- Unit: Individual component testing (models, services)
- Integration: End-to-end workflow testing (billing, inventory)
- Contract: API specification compliance testing
- Performance: Load testing for transaction volume requirements

### Code Quality Tools

**Decision**: Pre-commit hooks with black, isort, flake8, mypy  
**Rationale**:

- Constitutional code quality requirements
- Type checking with mypy for better maintainability
- Consistent formatting across development team
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline for automated quality gates

## Performance & Observability

### Monitoring Strategy

**Decision**: OpenTelemetry with Azure Monitor integration  
**Rationale**:

- Constitutional observability requirements
- Distributed tracing for multi-container architecture
- Custom metrics for GST transaction monitoring
- Performance tracking for <200ms API response requirement

**Monitoring Points**:

- API response times and error rates
- Database query performance
- Container resource utilization
- GST calculation accuracy and performance

### Backup & Recovery

**Decision**: Automated Azure Blob Storage backup with point-in-time recovery  
**Rationale**:

- 1-year retention requirement for GST compliance
- Cloud backup meets constitutional observability requirements
- Point-in-time recovery for financial data integrity
- Automated backup scheduling reduces operational overhead

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

**Decision**: Encryption at rest and in transit with Azure Key Vault  
**Rationale**:

- Financial data requires strong security
- Azure Key Vault for secret management
- TLS encryption for API communications
- Database encryption for sensitive customer and financial data

### Authentication & Authorization

**Decision**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control  
**Rationale**:

- Stateless authentication suitable for containerized deployment
- Role-based access for different user types (admin, operator, viewer)
- Integration capability with Azure Active Directory if needed

## Development Environment

### Local Development Setup

**Decision**: Docker Compose for local development environment  
**Rationale**:

- Consistent development environment across team
- Mirrors production container architecture
- Easy setup for new developers
- Integration with testing workflows

**Development Stack**:

- Python 3.11+ with virtual environment
- PostgreSQL container for local testing
- Hot reload for development efficiency
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality

## Next Steps

All technology decisions align with constitutional requirements:

- ✅ Code Quality: Type hints, automated formatting, quality gates
- ✅ Testing: 80%+ coverage strategy with comprehensive test types
- ✅ Performance: <200ms API targets with monitoring
- ✅ Observability: OpenTelemetry, Azure Monitor, structured logging
- ✅ User Experience: API-first design with consistent error handling

Ready to proceed to Phase 1: Data Model and API Contract design.
