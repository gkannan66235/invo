## Open Actions

- Implement remaining remediation & performance hardening tasks: T051, T054, T056–T060, T061–T066.
- Promote smoke tests into CI gating stage.
- Add concurrency-safe strategy for numbering (sequence table or advisory locks) before high load.

## Conclusion

Current implementation satisfies the majority of mandatory FR/NFR items with clear path for remaining hardening tasks. No critical blockers identified; proceed to finalize remaining tests and performance validations.
