    """T049: Editing amount/gst_rate after full payment should downgrade payment status appropriately.

    Flow:
      1. Create invoice amount 100, gst_rate 10 (total 110) -> status pending.
      2. Pay full (paid_amount == total_amount) -> status paid.
      3. Increase amount (e.g. amount 120) causing new total > paid_amount; expect downgrade to partial.
      4. Reduce amount drastically (e.g. amount 50, gst_rate 0) below paid_amount scenario â€“ service logic caps paid? Current implementation keeps paid_amount numeric; we then patch paid_amount down to 0 to ensure pending recalculation works.
